# Welcome to CSE442

This is to create a file so that your repo has a place to start.

For flask intallation:

https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/installation/
https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/v1.1/

https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/quickstart/

Instead of running the commands from quickstart manually, you can also navigate to the foder dictext/api and execute the bash file run.sh.
